John Doe: Good morning everyone. Let's discuss the new user authentication system requirements.

Jane Smith: Thanks John. I think we need to implement multi-factor authentication for security.

John Doe: Absolutely. That's a high priority requirement. Also, we need to support SSO with Azure AD.

Mike Johnson: What about password requirements? Should we enforce strong passwords?

Jane Smith: Yes, passwords must be at least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

John Doe: Good point. Let's also add a password reset functionality that sends email verification.

Mike Johnson: I'll take that task. I can have the password reset feature ready by next Friday.

Jane Smith: Perfect. Also, we need to ensure the system can handle 10,000 concurrent users.

John Doe: That's an important non-functional requirement. The system should also have 99.9% uptime.

Mike Johnson: Understood. I'll make sure the infrastructure team is aware of these requirements.

Jane Smith: One more thing - we should assume that users will have basic technical knowledge.

John Doe: Agreed. Let's also decide on the login page design. I think we should go with a modern, minimalist design.

Jane Smith: I agree with that decision. It will improve user experience.

Mike Johnson: Sounds good. I'll create mockups for review by end of week.
