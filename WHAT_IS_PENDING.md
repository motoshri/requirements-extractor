# 🚀 What's Pending for Product Deployment

## Summary

You asked: **"What all is pending? I want to give this tool to others. Should be approved based on email sent to admin."**

### ✅ **What I Just Built:**

1. **Approval System Backend** - Complete
   - Database tracks approval status (pending/approved/rejected)
   - Login checks if user is approved
   - Admin functions to approve/reject users

2. **Email Notification System** - Complete
   - Sends email to admin when user signs up
   - Sends email to user when approved
   - Sends email to user when rejected

3. **Documentation** - Complete
   - Deployment checklist
   - Implementation plan
   - Configuration guide

### ❌ **What's Still Missing (Critical):**

## 🔴 CRITICAL - Admin Panel

**The admin needs a way to:**
- Login as admin
- See pending users
- Click "Approve" or "Reject"
- View all users

**This is the ONLY critical blocker.** Everything else is ready.
